Introduction
************

This is a one dimensional glow discharge code using a pure fluid model. 
The model solves continuity equations for electrons, ions and neutral species
and poisson equation for electrostatic potential. Electron energy equation
is solved to obtain electron temperature used in reaction and transport
coefficient calculations. The model is similar to 
Yuan et al., IEEE Trans. Plasma. Sci., 31,4,2003.

Numerics
*******
The equations are discretized using first order upwind finite volume method.
The time integration is semi-implicit with AX=B solves done via
matrix-free GMRES with multi-grid preconditioning. Hence it uses number
of grid points as 2^n + 1 for simplicity.

Chemistry
*********

The chemistry file is stored in source/chemistry folder. It is
essentially a fortran module with reactions, species info and
rate calculation routines.
 
You can create your own chemistry here by changing nspecies,nreac
and adding reactions in assignreactions subroutine. The rate constants
are arrhenius by default. Custom rate expressions can be added using
getcustomrate function.  

How to compile
**************

You will need a working gfortran/ifort compiler. Set the relevant
parameters in the makefile. The chemistry file is set here. For
now a single ion electron chemistry is added in source/chemistry folder. 

To compile

$make

How to run
**********

move the executable plsolver_${CHEMFILEPREFIX}.exe to test folder.
The plasma parameter inputs are given in plasma_inputs file.

$./plsolver_${CHEMFILEPREFIX}.exe

This test run takes about an hour to run. You can view snapshots
using matplotlib python script

$python plotplasmaparams.py <solnfile>
